        <h5>What is this?</h5>
        <p>
          CrunchTime is a free and open source application to help university students plan their class schedules.
          It was originally developed by alumni and students of UC Santa Barbara. The application is white-label, meaning any university
          can configure the application with their own branding and connect it to their course APIs.
